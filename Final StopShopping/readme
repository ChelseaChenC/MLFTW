This is a fun project I made to control myself stop shopping online.

Yes as an aldut I clearly have no self control, I spent too much on blackfriday, and now you know, holiday season, more sales…


I don't believe positive motivations, I believe public shame or punishment are the only things can help me.

I trained my own KNN model, it can tell if I am using/reading/typing my credit cards.<br> So when it detects I am using card, it will push a notification to shame me.

It also will trigger a chop machine I built to chop my guilty hands off.


here is a demo video:
